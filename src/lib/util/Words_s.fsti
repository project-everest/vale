module Words_s

(*
Various representations of words with 2^n bits.

For example, a byte might be represented as a record of 8 bools, a sequence of 8 bools,
or a natural number 0 <= n < 256.  Sequences might be little endian or big endian.
A 32-bit word could be four bytes, 32 bools, or a natural number 0 <= n < 0x100000000.

This library defines various representations and conversions between them.
